# Intro

***
Currently, 3.1 million young people in Europe aged 15-24 cannot find a job. The number of people not in education, employment, or training aged 15-29 is 9.6 million, and they often cannot contribute to society because of low self-esteem, low motivation, low level of developing working skills, and lack of mastery in school and in daily life. At the same time, youth already participating in education and training do not always receive adequate information about possible career choices. Innovative solutions are needed to include these groups in the working life or training programs. Research in digital career guidance emphasizes online communication, video, chat, and other tools. Immersive technologies have been used in vocational education in several contexts, but their use in career guidance is largely unexplored.


We aim to establish an international partnership in applying Virtual Reality for vocational education and career guidance, providing a standard of excellence in this area. We aim to build best practices in educational virtual reality, virtual reality for work, vocational education, and career guidance.

This repository holds a Unity project with demo Scenes and the core Prefabs to create VR experiences for the VR4VET project. The goal is to standardize all the experiences(games) and make the development of new ones easier and faster.

- Note: For a detailed explanation on how to contribute and use the various components, check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/vr4vet/vr4vet/wiki).

## Installation/Requirements

1. First you need to download Unity [**2021.3.5f1**](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.5) using this link or through the Unity Hub.

2. Get a copy of [VRI Framework](https://wiki.beardedninjagames.com/).

3. Clone the Develop branch using git clone. 

4. Copy the previously downloaded VRI/BNG Framework into the project Assets. The resulting address should be "Assets/BNG Framework".

5. After populating the BNG folder you may have to pull again.

## Controls
