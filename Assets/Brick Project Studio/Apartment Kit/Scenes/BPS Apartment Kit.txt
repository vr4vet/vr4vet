Thank you so much for downloading the Brick Project Studio Apartment Kit.

The Build Kit folder in this assets walls ceilings & floors follows a grid system of X / Z / Y = 2.5 / 2.5 / 4.  By using Unityâ€™s build-in Progrids it can assist in building structures quickly.

The doors and drawers can be opened and closed in the demo scenes by clicking on them.  Included is a PDF named Prefab Doors in this folder that show you how to link your player to the script so you can have them working on your own creations.

Please rate and review the package, it really helps support my direction on creating new content and improve older assets. 

If you have any ideas on my next package or how to improve on this package, please send me an email on your suggestions to support@sojaexiles.com

Thank you again!
