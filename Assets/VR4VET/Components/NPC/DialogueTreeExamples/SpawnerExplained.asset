  - dialogue:
    - 'Hello, I have been spawned at runtime and I will tell you more about it here. '
    - I am defined in a Scriptable Object called NPC. There you can decide my name,
      my appearance, my voice,  what I like to talk about, and more.
    - 'You can easily turn on and off functionality.

      For example, should the
      NPC follow the player or not?'
    - The prefab NPCSpawner has methods for spawning the NPC with basic behavior.
    - You can add your own script to an unpacked NPCSpawner if you want to specify
      the NPC behavior more.
    - That is all I know, but you can look at the Scriptable Objects in NPCExamples
      and NPCSpawner in the scene to learn more.
    - 'Walk to the pressure plate in front of the box on the right-hand side to start
      a task. '
