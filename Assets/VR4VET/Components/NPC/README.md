## Dialogue tree

- To use the dialogue tree on an NPC the DialogueBoxController and NPCManager scripts are added to the NPC object as components.

- A DialogueTree is a scriptable object that can be specified in Unity with dialogue, questions and answer boxed unique to that NPc.
  - This dialogue tree is then assigned to the NPC in the Dialogue Tree attribute defined in the NPC manager script.
  - The structs file is used by the DialogueTree.

- In the DialogueBoxController script, the Dialogue Text, NPC Name Text, Dialogue Box, Answer Box and Answer Objects are assigned.
  - The boxes are containers for the text objects, and the Dialogue text value is sat depending on the dialogue written in the Dialogue Tree object.
  - The Answer Objects is defined by the Answers written in the Dialogue Tree.

## Follow the Player

- First create an empty game object and add the script component called PlayerManger. As player drag and drop the object you want the NPC to follow. There can only be one player in each scene (singleton). E.g. for the prefab called Player drag the CameraRig into the player-field of the script.
- window -> panels -> 6 Navigation. In this window can you specify which areas of the map the NPC can walk on. So each time you make a change to the landscape of the map, you need to press bake here in the tab
